Hi, I am a senior student in the Department of Astronomy at [Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/) (advisor: Bin Luo).
I am interested in unusual quasars (e.g., weak line quasars), which provide insights into quasar accretion physics and structure. I have been using multiwavelength data and TDO (the thick disk and its outflow) model to explain the X-ray weakness and variability of WLQs.
